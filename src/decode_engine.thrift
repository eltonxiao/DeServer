/**
 * The first thing to know about are types. The available types in Thrift are:
 *
 *  bool        Boolean, one byte
 *  byte        Signed byte
 *  i16         Signed 16-bit integer
 *  i32         Signed 32-bit integer
 *  i64         Signed 64-bit integer
 *  double      64-bit floating point value
 *  string      String
 *  binary      Blob (byte array)
 *  map<t1,t2>  Map from one type to another
 *  list<t1>    Ordered list of one type
 *  set<t1>     Set of unique elements of one type
 *
 * Did you also notice that Thrift supports C style comments?
 */

// Just in case you were wondering... yes. We support simple C comments too.

/**
 * Thrift files can reference other Thrift files to include common struct
 * and service definitions. These are found using the current path, or by
 * searching relative to any paths specified with the -I compiler flag.
 *
 * Included objects are accessed using the name of the .thrift file as a
 * prefix. i.e. shared.SharedObject
 */

/**
 * Thrift files can namespace, package, or prefix their output in various
 * target languages.
